  ## Adam Kraft
  ### Machine Learning and Computer Vision
---

I currently work at [Orbital Insight](https://orbitalinsight.com/), which is a Seqouia Capital and Google Ventures backed startup focusing on geospatial analytics. 
Our CV/ML team works on applying ML to enormous volumes of geospatial data (images from satellites and airplanes).
Before Orbital Insight, I worked at [A9 / Amazon](https://www.a9.com) on the Visual Search team.
A9 develops the computer vision for all of the Amazon apps, including the "Search by Camera" feature.
I graduated in 2011 with a BS/MS in Computer Science from Washington University in St. Louis, working with [Robert Pless](https://www.cs.seas.gwu.edu/robert-pless).
